# Angul-It: A Dynamic Captcha Application üõ°Ô∏è

A multi-stage, dynamic captcha application built with the latest version of Angular. This project demonstrates a complete, modern web application from development to containerization, featuring animations, responsive design, and a full suite of unit tests.



## üéØ Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to create a user-friendly yet bot-resistant verification system. It serves as a comprehensive example of building a full-featured Angular application, including:
-   Component-based architecture
-   Service-based state management
-   Advanced animations
-   Responsive design principles
-   Unit testing with Karma and Jasmine
-   Production deployment with Docker and Nginx

## ‚ú® Features

* **Dynamic Challenges**: Each session generates a random number of challenges (from 3 to 6) with randomized types.
* **Multiple Challenge Types**: Includes math problems (addition and subtraction) and text recognition.
* **Bot-Resistant SVGs**: Challenges are rendered as SVG images with visual noise, making them difficult for simple bots to scan.
* **Session Persistence**: Your progress is saved in `localStorage`, so you can refresh the page and continue where you left off.
* **Fluid Animations**: Smooth transitions between pages and individual challenges.
* **Responsive Design**: A clean and functional UI that works on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Tested Codebase**: Includes a suite of unit tests to ensure the application's logic is reliable.
* **Dockerized for Production**: Comes with a multi-stage `Dockerfile` for building a small, efficient, and production-ready Nginx container.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Angular**
* **TypeScript**
* **Nginx**
* **Docker**
